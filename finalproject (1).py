Questions we want to investigate:
Is a movieâ€™s IMBd score positively correlated with its Hidden Gem score? Or do ratings for the same movies
diverge significantly between platforms?
Which languages do contents mainly originate from and how many movies originate from each
language?
How has the proportion of different view ratings (e.g. R-rated, PG-13, PG, etc.) changed through time?
